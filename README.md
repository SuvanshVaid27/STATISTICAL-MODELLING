# Statistical-Modeling

Statistics is the foundation of Data Science and the concepts involved in statistics help provide insights into the data to perform quantitative analysis on it. As an aspiring Data Scientist, I consider it extremely essential to master the statistical concepts so that I am able to effectively connect the numbers with the probing questions. Below, I've shown a few demos of concepts related to statistics and machine learning. 

## [Linear Regression tutorial](https://github.com/SuvanshVaid27/STATISTICAL-MODELLING/tree/main/Simple-Linear-Regression-in-R)

  - A demonstration of how to use simple linear regression in R using the toydataset. Follow the link to check out the project: https://rpubs.com/SuvanshVaid27/simple-linear-regression
